For the hubitat system I want to create a groovy device drive (and potentially helper app if needed)

This shoud be a 'virtual contact sensor' -- it will combine multiple contact sensors where this device is the state of the last
contact sensor to change state.  This will be used to create a 'virtual contact sensor' that can be used in automations

use the folder this file is in to hold the code.

for the domain use "loghound" and my name is "John McLaughin"


Make a readme file and changelog for every time you do something.
